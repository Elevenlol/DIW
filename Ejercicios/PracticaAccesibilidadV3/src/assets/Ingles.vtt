00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.940
How are you, I'm Matthias and I'm here to

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.070
guide you in your first game of magic.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.680
To win a game of magic, we must

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.719
reduce the opponent's life total

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.600
from 20 to 0.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.940
Generally, we do this by attacking

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.310
with our creatures and casting

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.080
spells to ensure that the opponent

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.120
's creatures  opponent cannot

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.170
attack us

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.960
at the beginning of the game the decks are mixed

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.790
and it is decided randomly

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.000
who plays first you will draw a hand of

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.430
7 cards with which you can start the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.040
game if you consider it acceptable

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.780
otherwise you can try

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.930
again by mixing and drawing 7  new

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.360
cards once you find a

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.030
suitable hand you must return a card

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.370
to the bottom of the deck for each extra try

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.630


00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.620
there are two types of cards lands and

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.620
spells your game will always begin by

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.200
playing a land from your hand to the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.200
playing field you can play one land per

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.260
turn  the lands represent the mana

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.680
you will use to cast your spells you

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.320
will see each spell in magic has a

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.410
mana cost that indicates the number and

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.140
color needed to cast that spell

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.370
for example this card requires 2

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.130
white mana and 1 of any color while

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.460
this card  requires one red mana and 2

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.729
of any color this line indicates the

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.479
type of spell we are casting

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.520
some spells remain on the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.070
playing field such as creatures

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.690
planeswalkers artifacts or

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.750
enchantments while other types of

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.970
spells such as instants or

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.880
sorceries have an effect and then  they go to

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.910
your graveyard to cast any of

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.009
these spells you use your lands in

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.110
play to generate mana

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.390
to use your lands you simply

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.150
tap them to the right that is tapped

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.730
represents that the card has been used

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.220
for the turn at the beginning of each turn

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.650
untap all your cards  tapped

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.110
during your turn you can cast spells

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.920
before or after combat. These two

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.870
main phases of spellcasting

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.960
are when you can play a land from your

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.480
hand that you can summon creatures

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.670
or cast any spell for which

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.940
a particular type of spell is now available.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.820
Instants

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.430
can be played at any time

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.190
such as during combat or even

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.950
during the opponent's turn so

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.410
let's think of the turn as follows

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.770
your turn begins untap all

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.200
your cards and draw a new card for

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.840
your turn the only exception to this is the

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.630
first turn of the player who starts the

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.180
game where he will skip this phase for the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.209
only time then you can play a land

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.310
and cast any spell for which

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.170
you have mana available

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.270
then you can attack your opponent with

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.580
creatures available on your

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.310
playing field that you see fit once

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.260
Once the attackers are determined, your opponent

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.780
can select blockers from his

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.300
available creatures. Once the blocking phase is over,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.290
combat damage is assigned.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.630
You can then play a land again

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.790
if you have not played one prior to

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.250
combat and cast any spell for

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.280
which you finally have mana available.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.319
your turn ends and your

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.319
opponent's turn begins let's talk now about what

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.769
happens during combat this is the

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.470
strength of a creature during

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.049
combat creatures deal damage equal to

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:49.600
their strength

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.990
this is the toughness of a creature

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.270
takes damage equal to or greater than  their

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.200
resistance dies and goes to your semen. If

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.600
an attacking creature is not blocked

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.360
that damage goes to the player's life points

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.940
all creatures that were

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.300
damaged but not killed are

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.290
fully healed at the end of each turn

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.140
as the goal in magic is to reduce  the

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.500
opponent's life total from 20 to 0

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.199
your creatures will only attack your

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:24.680
opponent in combat you declare the

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.150
creatures you want to attack with

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.820
by tapping those creatures that

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.039
can block are only those that

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.860
are untapped remember so

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.530
a tapped creature will not be able to block

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.250
when  your opponent attacks you

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.960
important creatures cannot

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.580
attack the same turn in which they are

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.070
played because they suffer from

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.470
summoning sickness after selecting

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.110
attackers your opponent can select

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.169
blockers and which creatures block

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.840
which since multiple creatures

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.900
can block one  same attacker

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.120
then the damage resolves everything at the same

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.389
time in case of multiple blockers

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.210
the attacking player decides how to distribute

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.610
the damage between those creatures, having to

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.699
assign lethal damage to one first in order

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:16.160
to damage the next let's see an

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.590
example and take advantage of the opportunity

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.070
how instants work let's say

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.010
I am attacking with an onak ogre and my

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.170
opponent decides to block with a wishing crab

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.900
normally my creature

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.050
would die but I have in my

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.190
disfigured hand that it is an instant

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.990
at any time during the

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.419
combat phase I can play this instant I

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:44.960
pay its mana cost and  I play disfigure

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.419
on the wishing crab once

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:50.750
my opponent has decided on his blocker

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.240
now the crab is smaller and

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.160
it should be enough to win the

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.620
match

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.440
but then my opponent plays

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.169
titanic growth on his crab another instant

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:05.199
now his crab is bigger and  my

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:06.980
ogre dies

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.419
important remember that

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:12.150
instant spells can be cast even

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.280
in response to your opponent's spells

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.190
so that the last

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.950
spell cast is the one that will take effect

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.100
first once the combat and your two

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.650
main phases have ended you

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.380
pass the  turn to your opponent and those are

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.350
the bases for playing each card is unique

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.139
and affects the game and its rules in

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:36.510
different ways if you have doubts about how

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.610
a particular card works

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.889
you can search for it by name at gander

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:44.040
dot wizards dotcom and you will find

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.590
information on how  It works also

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.960
remember that magic arena has an

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.660
excellent tutorial to take your first

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.570
steps in the game now that you know the

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.910
basics you can go challenge your friends

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
hey how are you, I'm chus delighted and today I'm going

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.359
to start a series of videos in which

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.030
I'm going to explain how to play magic and

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.860
we're going to start from this video

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.520
telling the most basic things

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.140
[Music]

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.810
magic is a card game for two

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.480
players normally  playing a player

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.310
against another player against player,

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.610
although there are also other

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.040
game modes in magic that involve several

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.410
players within the same game, it is

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.270
a game in which you compete against the

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.430
other players and the player who

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.860
manages to reduce the total of  your

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.370
opponent's lives to 0 although the magic

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.870
you can also lose

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.600
if you are that player who when he is going to

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.489
draw cards from his deck he does not have

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.730
any more cards left to draw in that case

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.489
you also lose the game so magic

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.649
is a game where you can win but  You

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.930
can also lose

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.090
to start playing each player must

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.430
bring their own deck important to

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.260
check how good a

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.540
magic deck is not that it is a Spanish deck or

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.720
a French epoque deck or anything like that

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.400
shuffle the deck to give it 2 - like

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.580
I am doing  Hit the opponent to cut and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.250
then each player draws seven cards

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.770
that will be put in his hand. At that moment the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.900
decisions in magic begin.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.770
You must decide if with those cards that

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.420
you have in your hand you can play the

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.180
game and beat your opponent in case of

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.880
If you consider that that hand is not

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.020
enough to beat your opponent

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.330
because you have had bad luck, you

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.400
can always return seven cards from your hand,

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.910
shuffle again and draw another seven

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.580
new cards. You can repeat this process as

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.280
many times as you want until

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.040
you get a hand.  with which you are

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.990
happy with your cards and you think you

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.570
can win but be careful

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.400
once you decide that that hand is the

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.229
good one that that hand is the one you are going to

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.050
play with, you will have to return a card

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.229
from your hand to the bottom of your deck  For

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.350
every time you have done this process of

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.690
shuffling and drawing a new hand, this

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.450
rule is called the mulligan rule, a

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.550
rule that already has enough only air and

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.560
magic and that has changed several times

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.450
during the history of this game because I

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.070
remind you that  magic is a game that

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.709
is more than 25 years old and that has undergone

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.959
some changes from the beginning to

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.420
the time we are in now,

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.150
if you look at the cards in your hand you will

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.489
be able to easily differentiate them by

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.130
two types of cards, on the one hand we have

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.520
the lands that serve as a resource to

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.680
play the other type of cards that we have

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.930
in our hand the spells if you take a

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.850
look at the lands you will see that they are

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.850
closely related to each

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.770
of the five colors that exist in

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.920
magic so we can have for example

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.940
plains that are

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.000
related to the color white islands

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.920
that are related to the blue color

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.900
of magic swamps that are

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.930
related to the color black mountains

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.810
with the color red and forests with the color

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.530
green these five lands in magic are

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.200
called lands  basics and if you are a

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.209
little perceptive you will be able to notice that, for

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.790
example, in the mana symbol of this

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.269
plain, this symbol here

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.819
coincides quite closely with this symbol that

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.489
we have here above this

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.950
vote shield card, the entire combination of

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.840
symbols that appears  in the

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.670
upper right corner is

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.830
that it is difficult for us to play this card, for

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.200
example in this case the

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.510
devoted student only needs one point of

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.970
white mana so that we can play it from

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.730
our hand to the battlefield to

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.560
do that beforehand we will have to

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.750
use one of our lands  that

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.060
gives us white mana such as the

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.970
plain and play the shield before devotee we

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.730
will turn this land 90 degrees to the

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.410
right to indicate that we have already

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.410
used it to pay this card we cannot

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.959
use lands that we already have turned

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.050
to pay other cards for example  If

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.060
in our hand we have a pangolin of

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.400
darkness, which is a card that

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.769
costs us one point of black mala and two

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.570
additional sea points that we can

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.238
pay with mana of any color and we

00:04:19.238 --> 00:04:21.339
also have in our hand a

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.380
barrel archimÃ³ button area no that  It

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.900
costs two points of blue mana and one

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.120
point of additional mana that we can

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.550
pay with mana of any color, but

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.100
on the battlefield we

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.960
only have three lands. We must

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.360
choose on our turn which of these

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.030
two cards is best for us to play.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.160
Once we pay the  mana to

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.740
play one of those two cards we will not be able to

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.650
pay mana to play the other card since

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.420
these lands are lying

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.270
and we cannot play spells wandering mana

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.670
from the tapped lands we can play

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.280
as many spells in our turn as there are

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.650
lands we have interested in to be able to

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.140
pay and  We can play all of them but on the

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.840
other hand we can only play one land from

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.730
our hand in each of our

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.520
turns, but don't worry because at the

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.290
beginning of each of your turns

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.270
all the cards you

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.480
have turned return to their normal position to

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.900
this position in  magic is called

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.400
straightened, that is, a card when

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.070
this straight line is straightened and when it is

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.800
turned 90 degrees to the right it is

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.370
turned and therefore it has been used

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.980
[Music]

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.750
as magic is a game that has

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.240
many years behind it and has also

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.310
experienced  a little with the

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.320
mana costs and we can find within

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.510
magic cards costs that are as

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.880
common as can be, for example,

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.300
bad habit or bad pyrexia. I

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.600
have also prepared a video that explains very

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.660
clearly and very clearly all the costs that

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.490
exist.  in magic so that you have an

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.400
expert in this matter of paying cards to

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.620
put them on the battlefield but if

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.780
we look at the spells not only are they

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.120
simply divided by color but they are

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.310
also divided by type depending on

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.260
what function they fulfill in the game

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.810
we will have  For example, the creatures that

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.850
represent the hosts that will fight

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.250
on our behalf to take the life of the

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.280
opponent to put them in trouble. We

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.290
also have artifacts that are

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.290
powerful magical objects that will also

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:26.730
help you a little in the game.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.700
We also have enchantments that

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.880
represent persistent magical effects.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.430
that last over time and

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.470
finally we also have

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.590
the controversial place walkers who are

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.390
powerful magicians who appear in the

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.180
setting story of magic these

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.130
four types of cards along with the

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.710
lands and the tokens which is a type of

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.860
card that already  We will talk about them later, they are

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.190
all permanent since when you

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.560
throw them on the table they stay

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.050
permanently until they are

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.600
destroyed or killed or the game is over

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.640
and you have to pick them up, it is not going to

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.290
be that you leave them there on the table but

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.030
as you can see  They have put a lot of effort into

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.650
classifying this type of cards, they

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.710
remain on the table permanently, their

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.320
heads have exploded, but there are also

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.270
cards that do not remain on the

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.520
battlefield, as may be the case with

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.910
spells and instants, which are

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:27.270
cards that when used  you play them you do

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.200
the effect that she puts directly they go

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.360
to the discard pile

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.060
in magic this discard sharpening is

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.550
called graveyard for example

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.099
on our turn we play a

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:44.560
mental rot which is a black spell that

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.930
costs us one point of black mana and two

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.819
points  of additional extras that we can

00:07:48.819 --> 00:07:51.039
pay with mana of any color and

00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:53.560
we choose a target player in this

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.750
case our opponent our opponent

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:59.110
must discard two cards from his

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:02.710
hand and send them to his graveyard and

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.020
once our opponent has done that

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.689
we will discard the rot

00:08:07.689 --> 00:08:10.000
mental and we will send it to our

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.120
cemetery and now we finally know

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.240
the most basic and elemental to begin to

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.759
see what a tÃº 9 magic is like and what a

00:08:18.759 --> 00:08:21.969
game in magic is like, that we will see in the

00:08:21.969 --> 00:08:24.669
next video better down here in the

00:08:24.669 --> 00:08:26.409
description of the  video and in the

00:08:26.409 --> 00:08:28.569
comments box I will leave you some other

00:08:28.569 --> 00:08:30.279
video that can serve as a

00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:33.399
complement to this remember that you can

00:08:33.399 --> 00:08:36.339
leave your doubts your hugs your

00:08:36.339 --> 00:08:38.589
dissolved your concerns and your neighbors

00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:41.110
down here in the comments

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.419
here with a video and I hope you like it
